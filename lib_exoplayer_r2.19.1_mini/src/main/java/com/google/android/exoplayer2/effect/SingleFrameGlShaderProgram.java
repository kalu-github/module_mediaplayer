/**
 * Manages a GLSL shader program for processing a frame. Implementations generally copy input pixels
 * into an output frame, with changes to pixels specific to the implementation.
 *
 * <p>{@code SingleFrameGlShaderProgram} implementations must produce exactly one output frame per
 * input frame with the same presentation timestamp. For more flexibility, implement {@link
 * GlShaderProgram} directly.
 *
 * <p>All methods in this class must be called on the thread that owns the OpenGL context.
 *
 * @deprecated com.google.android.exoplayer2 is deprecated. Please migrate to androidx.media3 (which
 *     contains the same ExoPlayer code). See <a
 *     href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media3/getting-started/migration-guide">the
 *     migration guide</a> for more details, including a script to help with the migration.
