1
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,360
Give Sarah my love.

2
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,350
...multiple lacerations.

3
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,940
My daughter, she's five years old.

4
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey. 

5
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,880
It's okay. You're in the hospital.

6
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,750
Are you in pain?

7
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,420
We can give you something.

8
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,890
Ellie! 

9
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,760
Ellie!

11
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,230
Here.

12
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,520
It's okay.

16
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,190
And how would you rate your pain? Scale of one to ten?

17
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,740
Nothing. Zero.

18
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,780
Zero. Can't ask for much more than that.

19
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,370
Okay. One last PFT.

20
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Look at that.

21
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Yeah.

22
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Alright. Today's the day.

23
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,590
- So, can I just-- - Almost.

24
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,130
I just need you to see one more person, then you're good to go.

25
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh, for fuck's sake.

26
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
- How are you doing? - Fine.

27
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,520
If you say it that fast, it kind of implies you're not.

28
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,810
Okay, ask me again.

29
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,980
How are you doing, Ellie?

30
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,610
Give me a moment. It's really complicated 'cause, you know, feelings.

31
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,820
Okay.

32
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh, come on, man, I've been stuck in here since...

33
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,040
Yeah, I miss him. He meant a lot to me. So, yeah. Upset and sad.

34
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,710
Of course.

35
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,750
But I was actually wondering about New Year's Eve.

36
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,220
You two got into it at the dance. Was that the last time you spoke to him?

37
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,850
Yeah.

38
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,680
When I got home, he was on the porch,

39
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,100
and I should've talked to him, but I didn't.

40
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
- Do you regret that? - Yeah, of course.

41
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,650
But your final moment with someone 

42
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,700
doesn't define your whole time with them.

43
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,370
It shouldn't, but it often does.

44
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,620
In my last moment with Joel, he said he

45
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,790
wronged you.

46
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe bad.

47
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,340
What is it that he said that he did?

48
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,930
Well, that's the thing. It didn't really make sense.

49
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,810
He said, "I saved her."

50
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,270
He saved me a lot of times.

51
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,310
Yeah, I would think so. But that's not wronging someone.

52
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,270
That's weird.

53
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,740
No idea what he meant.

54
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,820
I don't feel wronged.

55
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,500
Man, I wish I could have let him off the hook for whatever it was he was talking about.

56
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,170
I guess I'll have to let myself off the hook for that.

57
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,670
Well, you really are doing good.

58
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,380
Shit, 

59
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,340
if everyone were as healthy as you, what would I do for weed and booze?

60
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,510
I wouldn't worry, Gail, there's still a lot of fucked up people in this town.

61
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,850
Yeah. But not you, though.

64
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
Ellie?

65
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,640
Fuck.

66
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,980
Yeah, I'm coming.

67
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,990
I went to the hospital.

68
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,370
When'd they let you out?

69
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,080
- Thirty minutes ago. - Nice.

70
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,710
They made me talk to Gail.

71
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,380
I never said--

72
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,550
I should have said thank you for all those times you came to visit.

73
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,430
That's okay. You would have done the same for me.

74
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,980
- Yeah, maybe not as often. - Yeah, no, probably not.

75
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,690
I made you cookies.

76
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,860
Just 'cause?

77
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,440
This is a peace offering.

78
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,610
Because I'm about to make you angry.

79
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,410
In the hospital,

80
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,290
when you asked me 

81
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,540
about that day,

82
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,340
I told you I didn't learn anything useful.

83
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,380
That wasn't true.

84
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,720
I know most of their names, and I know where they're from.

85
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,810
Please, just listen. 

86
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,440
- The doctors told me not to upset you. - I don't give a fuck.

87
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,480
And I knew that if I told you where they were, you'd just start pulling your tubes out

88
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,440
and crawling on your hands and knees to get there.

89
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,230
I don't give a fuck.

90
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,700
You cost us time. You let them get away.

91
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,740
First of all,

92
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,370
this town was wreckage and funerals for weeks.

93
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,710
Nobody was gonna go after anyone.

94
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,000
And then it occurred to me, if you wanna find someone,

95
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,710
and the only thing you know about them is where they're gonna end up.

96
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,130
Maybe let them get there.

97
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,230
I loved him too, you know.

98
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,310
Okay, let's start with names.

99
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,610
The dark-haired guy was Manny. The other guy was Owen.

100
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,320
The girl with the dark hair and the bald one, one of them's named Nora. 

101
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,690
- I'm not sure which. - The girl with the braid?

102
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,820
Abby.

103
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,450
Abby.

104
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,040
Where are they from?

105
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,870
I saw a patch on a backpack.

106
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,130
Yellow triangle, wolf's head,

107
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,460
and the letters W-L-F.

108
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,170
And then, I remembered a story Eugene told me from back when he was a Firefly.

109
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
He said that there were these small regional groups in the West all trying to fight FEDRA,

110
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,220
and how stupid it was that they didn't just join together.

111
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,350
One of those groups was the Washington Liberation Front.

112
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,110
Out of Seattle.

113
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,320
W-L-F. Wolf.

114
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,610
Fucking morons.

115
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,110
- Did he say how small they were? - No.

116
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,450
But seeing as how no one's ever mentioned them since,

117
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm guessing small enough for us to handle.

118
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,040
Who else knows?

119
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
Just us.

120
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,540
I wasn't gonna tell anyone before you.

121
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,860
So, now what?

122
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,950
Well?

123
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,250
I gotta think about this.

124
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,710
Think about what? Let's fucking get these guys.

125
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,790
Ellie, it ain't that simple.

126
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,630
The town is still recovering. So are you. 

127
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,970
- We get where you're coming from-- - No, we don't get where you're coming from. 

128
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,640
I don't get where you're coming from. If it had been you, Joel would be halfway to Seattle before the sun came up.

129
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,260
He'd be halfway to Seattle to save my life.

130
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,890
But when we lost people, no.

131
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,980
It would just break him like it was his fault. 

132
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,270
I saw that time and time again. And don't talk to me like I didn't know him.

133
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,440
He was my brother.

134
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,780
Listen, I'm not sayin' you shouldn't do this.

135
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,200
But if we're gonna put a posse together, we gotta do it right, 

136
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,870
which means taking it to Maria. Yes, it's fuckin' necessary.

137
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,790
She's gonna want a council meeting, open it up to the town.

138
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,050
Everyone who wants to get heard gets heard.

139
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,670
But you'll back us, right?

140
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
Of course, I will.

141
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Come here.

142
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
And you, 

143
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,320
you hold out information on me again, you got rendering detail for a month.

144
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Alright.

145
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,490
Ellie.

146
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,910
We buried our dead ten miles south of town.

147
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,790
If you want to visit him.

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,550
When we're on our way to Seattle.

150
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,900
Well?

151
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,940
"No one following. All clear. Keep moving."

152
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,070
Good.

153
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,110
Once we get resettled, I'll teach you to whistle.

154
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,080
Why can't you tell me where we're going?

155
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,450
'Cause we don't know yet.

156
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
I've told you the reason we're going.

157
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,840
I know, but why can't she just keep us safe?

158
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,090
The Prophet?

159
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,430
She's been dead ten years, Constance. I wouldn't count on her to help.

160
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,180
But Ezra said the Prophet is eternal.

161
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,060
Well, she is, in a way.

162
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,100
A prophet isn't magic.

163
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,560
They're just 

164
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,810
people that see truths hidden from others

165
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,400
and share that truth, no matter what the cost.

166
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,440
So it was with our Prophet.

167
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,110
So it was.

168
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
That's how we keep her spirit alive.

169
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,700
Follow her words, we obey her teachings, but we keep ourselves safe.

170
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,710
Then, can I have a hammer?

171
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Alright.

172
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,390
Tell me, you feel safer?

173
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,010
Yes.

174
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Good.

175
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,770
Understand, what we're giving you now,

176
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,440
will keep you far, far safer than a hammer.

177
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,900
Distance.

178
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,820
From home.

179
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,490
From war.

180
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,290
Take cover! Go!

181
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,560
Demons?

182
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
Wolves.

183
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,900
Alright. Good, but rotate. More.

184
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,610
Now, the right side. Just the right side.

185
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,240
- Come on, man, that side hurts more. - I noticed.

186
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,910
- Come on. - Okay.

187
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,290
Harder. Harder! Let's go! Last five.

188
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,000
- There it is, okay. Done for the day. - Okay.

189
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,340
So, what'd you think?

190
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,380
Well, for someone who sat on their ass for three months, 

191
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,260
- I'm pleasantly surprised. - Yeah?

192
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,390
Push-ups?

193
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,390
Yeah, and crunches when they weren't looking.

194
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,600
Yeah, that'll do it. A few more weeks, and you'll be right back to where you were before.

195
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,100
Nice.

196
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,610
- Which is 80% of where you should have been. - Whatever. Fuck you.

197
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,490
So, I heard you're on the council now.

198
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,120
Yep.

199
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,620
So, you know about the meeting coming up?

200
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,290
I know about the meeting coming up.

201
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,500
Can I count on you?

202
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,750
I can't discuss upcoming votes.

203
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,420
- Seriously? It's me. - I know.

204
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,930
Dude, you were there.

205
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,340
I know that too.

206
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,510
Gotta go.

207
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,270
Oh, my God.

208
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Ellie.

209
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,860
The council won't make up their mind until we hear people speak.

210
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,980
So, here's a little advice.

211
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,990
Organize your thoughts, write them down, and then read 'em out loud tomorrow.

212
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,870
- Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm stupid. - 'Cause you're angry, Ellie.

213
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,580
And no one's gonna vote for angry.

214
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,460
Which is why I keep saying we need to invest more in turkeys 

215
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,800
and less in chickens.

216
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,260
And that brings me back to my earlier point about corn.

217
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,060
Corn, some of you have heard me say, is not the easiest crop to grow, 

218
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
but it is among the fastest.

219
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,810
You can plot a graph that shows ease and resources versus time to harvest and get a li--

220
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,520
Scott, I'm sorry, but we gotta keep you on target here.

221
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,990
But it's an open meeting. The bylaws say that--

222
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,200
Maybe we should stick to what everyone else came here to discuss.

223
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,200
I don't really have an opinion on the Seattle thing.

224
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,040
Okay. Thank you.

225
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,620
So, that was Scott. Next is Rachel.

226
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,880
Yeah, Joel meant so much to so many of us.

227
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,960
Can't hear you.

228
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,550
- Can you take him, please? - Yeah. 

229
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,680
Okay, here we go.

230
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,600
I said that Joel meant so much to so many of us.

231
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,060
But he wasn't the only one.

232
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,940
I lost my sister that day.

233
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,190
A lot of people in here buried family.

234
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,610
And now, you wanna send, what, you're saying 16 of our best?

235
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,200
Well, while they're gone, who's gonna be on the wall if Raiders come?

236
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,120
A wall that's barely mended.

237
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,870
And none of you up there can promise us that all 16 will come back.

238
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,590
So, my heart is with you, Tommy and Ellie.

239
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,760
We are too hurt, and it is too soon.

240
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,220
Thank you, Rachel.

241
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,100
Next is Carlisle.

242
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,230
I'll be quick. 'Cause this one's simple to me.

243
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,980
People came 

244
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
and killed Joel.

245
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,450
So, why wouldn't we wanna take our vengeance?

246
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Well, because we're not supposed to.

247
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,410
Forgive and be forgiven.

248
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,130
No grudges. No revenge.

249
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,090
And I'm not even a Christian. I've always seen the wisdom in that.

250
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,970
That's what separates us from the Raiders and the murderers.

251
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,800
Our capacity for mercy.

252
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,060
Those sons of bitches don't deserve our mercy.

253
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,770
Well, of course they don't deserve it.

254
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,230
That's what makes it mercy.

255
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,110
Well, to hell with that. And to hell with you for saying it, Carlisle.

256
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,230
- Seth, sit down. - No.

257
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,820
- You're not on the list. - No!

258
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,530
What the hell are we all talking about here?

259
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,950
It's not fair.

260
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,490
What, we gotta forgive everybody when they show up and piss in our eye?

261
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,410
They came into our house.

262
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,370
They took one of ours.

263
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,130
My God, 

264
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,500
somebody shoots your brother, you wanna take the locks off your doors?

265
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,880
Grow up!

266
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,840
You idiots, they'll come back.

267
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,760
They'll come back because we didn't make 'em pay.

268
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,390
And when they come back, they'll be laughing.

269
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,850
And you'll all deserve it.

270
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Bunch of 

271
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,980
goddamn victims.

273
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,500
Ellie?

274
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,140
I normally don't write things down

275
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,610
because I normally don't think before I talk,

276
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,730
which has gotten me in trouble before, a lot,

277
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,240
and it's cost me in ways that sometimes couldn't be undone.

278
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,580
But I can't afford that right now, because I know what I'm asking is a lot.

279
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm asking us to risk more people and resources,

280
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,250
and at the worst possible time.

281
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,340
And I want everyone to know, it's not because I want revenge.

282
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,800
It's not. It's not about revenge.

283
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,260
What I want is what you used to give people.

284
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,970
I want justice.

285
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,560
Because it's either that, or we do nothing.

286
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,390
That's what everyone else out there is going to do for us.

287
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,190
Nothing. A whole world of people who won't lift a finger

288
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,150
if something bad happens to me or you.

289
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,490
We have a word for these people.

290
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,110
They're called strangers.

291
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,910
Well, I don't think that we're strangers to each other.

292
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,450
And I want to know that I can count on you.

293
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,370
And I swear, if someone hurts any of you or the people you love, 

294
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,000
you can count on me.

295
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,460
That's what holds all this together.

296
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,340
Not potluck dinners or New Year's Eve dances.

297
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,010
Definitely not a wall, because that thing got busted through.

298
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,010
But Jackson is still here.

299
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,350
I'll accept whatever the council decides.

300
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
But I am asking you, please,

301
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,610
do what it takes to see that justice is done.

302
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
Not for me. 

303
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,570
Not even for Joel.

304
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,830
I am asking you, please, do it for us.

305
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
Thank you.

306
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,310
The council will now vote on the proposal to send a party of 16 citizens to Seattle

307
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,930
to find the people who killed Joel and execute them.

308
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
Amy-Beth?

309
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
Yes.

310
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
No.

311
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,930
Yes.

312
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,520
No.

313
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,270
No.

314
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,730
Yes.

315
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,610
No.

316
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
No.

317
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
No.

318
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
No.

319
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,990
No.

320
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,790
The vote is 8 to 3. The proposal is rejected.

321
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,670
Adjourned.

322
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,410
Here we go, nine. Here we go.

323
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,910
Grab the ball!

324
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,920
Attaboy, nine!

325
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,750
Oh, shit.

326
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,710
I didn't know you were a fan.

327
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,220
Hell, yeah! I had Tigers season tickets.

328
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,600
This actually isn't that far off from the '03 squad.

329
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,270
You want a beer? I get them from Marshall.

330
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,070
I spotted you in the crowd at the meeting today.

331
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,410
Yeah.

332
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,040
And I thought to myself,

333
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,370
she's probably been extra busy these last few weeks.

334
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,750
Brutal.

335
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,010
And I'm supposed to see a shrink myself, you know, to process it all, it's...

336
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,130
I'm the only one here.

337
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,140
- So, what do you do, then? - Oh, well, I'm an alcoholic.

338
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,510
And I smoke as much weed as I can.

339
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,470
You know, complete fuckin' disaster.

340
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,390
But you're not here 'cause you're worried about me.

341
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,520
Two outs, guys, two outs. Look alive!

342
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,730
I don't know.

343
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,070
You see things that others don't.

344
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,280
I'm nervous she's gonna do somethin' stupid.

345
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,660
- What, you didn't believe her speech? - Did you?

346
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,540
Course not. She's a liar.

347
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,620
Well, there's a difference between lyin' and being a liar.

348
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,170
Oh, I know. And that one? Liar.

349
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,630
There was maybe one person she told the truth to, and he's...

350
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,630
But we can agree to disagree about that.

351
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,220
What matters is you're afraid. So, let's talk about it.

352
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,180
Okay. Free of charge.

353
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,400
I just don't want her to go down the same paths that Joel did.

354
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,740
Comin' up with justifications and such.

355
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,240
All he was really doin' was lashin' out.

356
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,240
So, you think she might have learned that behavior from him?

357
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,670
Turns out nurture can only do this much. The rest is nature.

358
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,130
If she's on a path, it's not one that Joel put her on.

359
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,970
No. No.

360
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,600
I think they were walking side by side from the very start.

361
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,230
Tommy, I get it.

362
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,100
You inherited her, and you wanna keep her out of trouble.

363
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,110
Take it from a psychotherapist of 40 years.

364
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,110
Some people just...

365
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,820
Some people just can't be saved.

366
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,480
- Who is it? - Dina.

367
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,400
Hey.

368
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,740
I'm just going to bed.

369
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,990
No, I don't think that is where you're going.

370
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,620
Are you alone?

371
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,500
I'm alone.

372
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Get in.

373
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Oh, Christ.

374
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,890
- Please don't try and talk me out of this. - You think that's why I'm here?

375
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,140
So, what's your plan?

376
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,110
Go to Seattle and kill Abby.

377
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,400
What route?

378
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,150
Northwest.

379
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,570
And is that all guns, or do you have medical supplies in there? No?

380
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,450
Well, better not land weird on an ankle

381
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,960
or get a fever on your well-charted path "northwest."

382
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,960
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?

383
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,510
Stay off the highways. Steer clear of cities or settlements.

384
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,550
First stage is through the national forest.

385
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,890
Once we're out, we follow the Snake River Canyon,

386
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,850
- then break off through the Snoqualmie Pass. - Snoqualmie?

387
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,890
Yeah. Snoqualmie.

388
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,770
Approach Seattle from the east, then reassess based on what we find.

389
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,530
Provisions. Travel light, but smart.

390
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,570
Winter coats for beds, jackets for blankets.

391
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,950
First aid kits, batteries, bear spray. Now, handguns. What are you bringing?

392
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,240
Is that Joel's?

393
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,170
So, that's what you're gonna kill her with?

394
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,250
- Fuckin' right. - Then, save it for that.

395
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,840
It's slow and kicks like hell.

396
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,840
Really? Shoot your damn ass off?

397
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,760
I've heard that before.

398
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,800
We'll want at least 100 shells apiece, plus 50 rifle rounds.

399
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,310
Bring any long gun you want, as long as it's scoped.

400
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,180
Chlorine tablets, a pan, and something to keep Shimmer dry.

401
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,850
- Just Shimmer? - Yeah.

402
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,690
We share a horse. Fewer resources.

403
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,360
Everything else is what you'd figure, except this.

404
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Boots.

405
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,320
Love the Converse. Respect your consistency.

406
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,530
But you're not crossing open country in fuckin' Chucks.

407
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,910
- I've done it before. - No Chucks. Questions?

408
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,540
Yeah, one. How the fuck are we gonna get all of this?

409
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,790
I know a guy.

410
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,580
Oh, no. No, don't tell me you told Jesse, please.

411
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,790
Captain Wyoming? No.

412
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,220
I love the man, but he's a little uptight about rules and shit.

413
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,800
Wear all the clothes you're gonna bring, fill your pockets with ammo.

414
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,100
Everything else needs to fit inside a holster or your backpack.

415
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,060
We'll meet by the old east gate, 3:00 a.m.

416
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,890
3:00 a.m.

417
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,690
Hey.

418
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Thank you.

419
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,110
You know, you could have just asked.

420
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,950
No, I actually didn't know that.

421
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Now you do.

422
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,950
Trade.

423
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,160
It's better. Trade.

424
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,350
How'd you get her out?

425
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,560
Jeanine's night watch at the stables. She's sympathetic to our cause.

426
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,940
"Our cause"?

427
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,610
You're the one that gave the "us" speech, not me.

428
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,280
Saddlebags are filled with stuff I had squirreled away.

429
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,870
Two weeks' worth of hardtack, bandages, alcohol, meds, batteries.

430
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,370
I'd come with you, but I caught some friendly fire on New Year's Day.

431
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,040
- You sure it was friendly? - Jesus Christ.

432
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,380
We got ten minutes before a patrol comes by. Let's get you going.

434
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,400
Okay, so...F.

435
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,780
F. Fleetwood Mac. 

436
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,160
- Nope. - What? 

437
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,870
What do you mean, "no"? It's my opinion.

438
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, well, your opinion is wrong because Frank Zappa exists.

439
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,130
Okay, so, G.

440
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,420
- Green Day. - No, you're wrong. It's Guns N' Roses.

441
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,010
Ozzy Osbourne.

442
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,270
Nice! Double points.

443
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,810
L M N O P
So, L-M-N-O, P.

444
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,360
Are you seriously gonna make me do the entire alphabet?

445
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,030
We don't have to. I'm incredibly flexible. Lemme see, new topic.

446
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,700
- Or silence. - Got one. First person you killed.

447
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,120
Jesus, really?

448
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,080
Yeah, fun stories of childhood.

449
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,000
Okay, well, the first one's too fucked up, but I can tell you the second one.

450
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,040
I accept.

451
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,130
It was a little before Joel and I got to Jackson.

452
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,550
In Kansas City, he got jumped by this kid, maybe just a couple years older than me.

453
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,180
And I came up behind him, raised my gun and, yeah.

454
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,060
Sorry, Ellie.

455
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,980
Interesting. I shoot a guy, and you feel sorry for me?

456
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,770
I'm just loyal like that.

457
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,610
Let me know if you see any outcroppings or spots with cover.

458
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,240
Why? It looks okay.

459
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,830
Holy shit, that came on fast. How the fuck did you know that was gonna happen?

460
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,170
- I'm a witch. - Clearly.

461
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,950
Well, good night.

462
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,950
Night.

463
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,340
Okay, but I have a stupid question.

464
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,440
It's about New Year's Eve, and, you know,

465
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,520
the kiss.

466
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,400
Okay. I mean, whatever, you were super high.

467
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,990
And you were drunk.

468
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,830
Right, so it doesn't mean anything, if that's what you're asking.

469
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,870
No, I know that. My question is,

470
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,870
how would you rate it?

471
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,420
- Scale of one to ten. - No.

472
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,300
Come on. You've kissed girls before. 

473
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,880
You're gay, I'm not.

474
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,470
I'm just curious. I wanna know if I'm any good at it.

475
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,260
One to ten.

476
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,270
Okay, fine. Six.

477
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,980
- Fuck you, "six." - That's not bad.

478
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,730
That sucks!

479
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,190
What?

480
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,110
For the record, I don't believe you.

481
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,410
Well, you asked, and I told you. I'm sorry.

482
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,410
You can go back to Jesse.

483
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,620
I already did.

484
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,210
Well, there you have it.

485
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,010
Does he ever strike you as sad?

486
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,890
Jesse? Yeah.

487
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,680
Has he ever told you why?

488
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,310
No.

489
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,030
But I think deep inside, that's just how he is.

490
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,660
- At least, I hope that's why. - Why would you hope that?

491
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,460
Well, because if it's not that,

492
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,580
then it's me.

493
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,470
Well, good night.

494
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,470
Night.

495
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Ellie?

496
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,610
I wasn't that high.

498
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,750
How much further?

499
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Close.

500
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,880
Maybe ten miles?

501
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,130
In theory, we'll come out near Highway Five, just north of the city.

502
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,860
He was running away.

503
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,450
What's that symbol?

504
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,070
I don't know, I've never seen it before.

505
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,630
A lot of different calibers. I don't think this was FEDRA.

506
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,760
Dina.

507
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
Dina?

508
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,900
- You okay? - It's just...

509
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Doing okay?

510
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,960
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just that's never happened before.

511
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,470
- I think it was the smell. - It wasn't easy to look at either.

512
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,640
If this was fucking them,

513
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,640
if Abby and her crew did this to people,

514
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,850
to kids?

515
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,980
Yeah.

516
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,030
Let's go.

517
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,890
We're close now.

519
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,380
It's quiet.

520
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,800
Yeah. Too quiet.

521
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,430
Curtis or Viper?

522
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,220
Both, in all four movies.

524
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,350
Nine more miles.

525
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,110
Nine more.

526
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,010
Fucking Seattle. Pretty.

527
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,680
Plus, no one's shooting at us.

528
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,100
I guess there aren't that many Wolves.

529
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,270
There's about to be a whole lot less.

530
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,610
- Curtis or Viper? - What?

531
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,360
No, that was just me. I was trying to sound like a badass.

532
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,370
You don't need to try.

533
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
Manny.

534
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,390
Yeah, go ahead.

535
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,150
We're moving up to the FOB. All clear between checkpoint three and five?

536
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:26,820
Told me to watch six and eight. Now, they want fuckin' three and five.

537
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,740
Manny, you copy?

538
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,790
Just give me a fuckin' second. Jesus.

539
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,880
You're all good. You can move up.
